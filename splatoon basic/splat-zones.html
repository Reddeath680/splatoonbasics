                    <p> <a id="make-me-blue">this game mode you have to turf the pacific zone for period of time. Opponent well try to splat you to cover the zone depends the score you have to wait for score keep counting. weapons well be goood in splat Zones is Hydra Splatling or Nautilus 47 are good picks. they be in back fireing at Opponent and the zone. Roller's are good pick too they cover a lot of ground and ohko (one hit ko) anyone who get caught by one. if you not good if any of them you can pick up any Shooters Weapons they have decent range and good cover the ground.</a></p>
